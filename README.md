## Description
This app is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developer's posts as well. This app utilizes the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication!

## Installation
Clone the repo and install a .env file with your credentials. For ease, the app can be accessed on heroku [here]!

## Usage
Navigate to the homepage and select the location you would like to view. You will be prompted to login or create an account. Once signed in, you can view the available animals and their data (including names, breeds, weights, coat colors, and arrival dates) as well as their image. Each location will list their opening and closing times so that you can plan a trip to adopt your new pet and give them their new Furever Home!
